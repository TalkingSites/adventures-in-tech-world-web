# About Tech World

Tech World is an **educational multiplayer 2D pixel game** built with Flutter and the Flame game engine. Players explore a retro-inspired world, solve coding challenges, and collaborate in real time — all in the browser. Think Stardew Valley, but for tech people.

## The World

Set across **6 unique maps** — Open Arena, The L-Room, Four Corners, Simple Maze, The Library, and The Workshop — Tech World is a place for tech enthusiasts to gather, learn, and connect. Each map is fully explorable with wall occlusion, meaning your character walks behind walls just like a classic RPG.

## Clawd — Your AI Tutor

Every player has access to **Clawd**, an AI tutor powered by Claude. Ask questions, get code hints, and receive instant feedback on your solutions — all without leaving the game world. Clawd also supports voice input and output for a truly hands-free learning experience.

## The Vision

Tech World is an educational prototype being developed with support from Screen Australia's Games Production Fund. Our goal is to grow it from a working prototype into a fully featured game — an accessible, engaging space where people can discover programming through play, together.
