SpaceClub! has a full event system with support for dates, times, locations, upcoming/past separation, featured events, galleries, and links to recap posts.

Each event is a Markdown file in the `src/events/` folder.

---

## Creating an Event

1. Copy `src/events/template.md` and rename it (e.g. `src/events/open-day.md`).
2. Edit the front matter and content:

```markdown
---
title: Open Day
description: Come visit us and see what we're all about!
eventDate: 2026-05-15
startTime: 10:00 AM
endTime: 3:00 PM
location: "Community Hall\n123 Main Street, Springfield"
image: /assets/images/open-day.jpg
---

We're hosting an open day! Come along and meet the team.

## What to Expect

- Tours of the space
- Free refreshments
- Live demos
```

3. Save the file. The event will appear on the events page and, if upcoming, on the homepage.

## Front Matter Properties

| Property | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | Yes | The event name. |
| `description` | Recommended | A short summary shown on event cards and in search results. It also appears in search result previews and in SEO meta tags. |
| `eventDate` | Yes | The event date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (e.g. `2026-05-15`). Used for sorting and determining upcoming vs. past. |
| `startTime` | No | The start time (e.g. `10:00 AM`, `14:00`). Displayed on the event page and cards. |
| `endTime` | No | The end time. Also used to determine if an event is still "upcoming" - an event is considered past once its end time has passed. If not set, the event is considered past after midnight on the event date. |
| `location` | No | The venue or address. Supports multi-line with `\n` - use quotes around the value. |
| `image` | No | Path to a header image shown on the event card (e.g. `/assets/images/open-day.jpg`). |
| `preview_image` | No | A separate image for search result previews. |
| `featured` | No | Set to `true` to mark as a featured event. |
| `recapPost` | No | URL of a related blog post (e.g. `/posts/open-day-recap/`). Displays a "Read the recap post" link on the event page. |
| `gallery` | No | Path to a folder of images to show as a gallery. See [[Gallery]]. |
| `hideEventDetails` | No | Set to `true` to hide the date/time/location block on the event page (useful for non-traditional event pages). |

> **Title and description matter beyond the event page itself.** The title shows up in browser tabs, search results, and when links are shared. The description appears in search result previews and SEO meta tags. Even if you haven't set up search yet, writing a clear title and description for every event is good practice from the start. See [[Search]] for how the search system uses these fields.

## How Events Are Sorted

Events are automatically sorted and categorised:

- **Upcoming events** - Events whose end time (or end of day if no `endTime`) is in the future. Sorted by date ascending (soonest first).
- **Past events** - Events whose end time has passed. Sorted by date descending (most recent first).

The timezone used for this calculation is set in `src/_data/site.json` (`timezone` field).

---

## Events Listing Page

The `/events/` page is generated by `src/events/events.njk`. It shows two sections:

1. **Upcoming Events** - All future events.
2. **Past Events** - All completed events.

You generally don't need to edit this file.

---

## Homepage Preview

The homepage shows a preview of upcoming events via the `homeCards.njk` partial. By default, it shows up to 2 upcoming events and 1 recent past event.

---

## Featured Events

To feature an event:

```yaml
---
title: Annual Gala
eventDate: 2026-12-01
featured: true
---
```

Featured events can be shown separately using the `featured.njk` partial. This is available on the homepage but commented out by default in `homeCards.njk`.

When the homepage uses preview mode with `excludeFeatured`, featured events are excluded from the regular preview list and shown in the featured section instead. This prevents duplication.

---

## Multi-line Location

Use `\n` for line breaks in the location. Wrap the value in quotes:

```yaml
location: "Outer Space Hub\n101 Star Lane\nMeridian 7, Dione"
```

This renders as:

> Outer Space Hub  
> 101 Star Lane  
> Meridian 7, Dione

---

## Linking Events to Posts

You can link an event to a recap blog post:

**In the event:**
```yaml
recapPost: /posts/open-day-recap/
```

**In the post:**
```yaml
eventPage: /events/open-day/
```

Both pages will display a link to the other. See [[Posts]] for more details.

---

## Adding Buttons

The `btn.njk` partial creates a styled button. To add a button anywhere in your event content, set variables immediately before the include:

```nunjucks
{% set text = "Register Now" %}
{% set href = "https://example.com/register" %}
{% set icon = "ticket-perforated" %}
{% set style = "primary" %}
{% include "partials/btn.njk" %}
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | "Back to Home" | Button label. |
| `href` | "/" | The URL the button links to. |
| `icon` | "arrow-left" | Bootstrap icon name without the `bi-` prefix. See [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/). |
| `style` | "primary" | Bootstrap button style - `primary`, `outline-primary`, `secondary`, `outline-secondary`, etc. |
| `align` | "center" | Alignment - `start`, `center`, or `end`. |

You can add as many buttons as you like anywhere on the page, each with different settings:

```nunjucks
{% set text = "Register Now" %}
{% set href = "https://example.com/register" %}
{% set icon = "ticket-perforated" %}
{% include "partials/btn.njk" %}

{% set text = "View Location" %}
{% set href = "https://maps.google.com" %}
{% set icon = "geo-alt" %}
{% set style = "outline-primary" %}
{% include "partials/btn.njk" %}
```

The event layout also automatically includes a default `btn.njk` ("Back to Home") at the bottom of every event page. To change that default, edit `src/_includes/layouts/event.njk`.

## Tips

- **Filenames matter** - The filename becomes the URL. Use lowercase with hyphens: `open-day.md` → `/events/open-day/`.
- **Date format** - Always use `YYYY-MM-DD` for `eventDate` in front matter. The display format is controlled by `site.json`.
- **Hiding the template file** - Rename `src/events/template.md` to `template.njk` to hide it from the events listing. The events collection only scans `*.md` files, so `template.njk` won't appear in any events list. The file will still be built as a page so you can use it as a reference, but it won't show up where you don't want it.
- **Time parsing** - Use formats like `10:00 AM`, `2:30 PM`, or `14:00`. The `AM`/`PM` format with a space before it works most reliably.
